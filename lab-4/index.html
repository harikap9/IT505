        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The paper looked at issues concerning choice of career among students. After a brief look at what 
            career choice and development is, the paper describes some terms associated with career; terms that 
            are considered synonymous by many but are actually different. Furthermore, the paper discusses various 
            assumptions or perspectives underlying career choice, such as the belief that opportunities and choices 
            should be available for all people.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            In the past, most people prepared for a job and remained in that line until they retired. 
            Consequently, the laymanâ€™s understanding of career development is from a static perspective. 
            But now, as occupations are changing rapidly and society is becoming increasingly complex.

        <p>Career development (in the context of career orientation) is a lifelong process which 
            involves the management of learning, work and transition in order to advance and head towards a 
            determined individual future developed personally.
