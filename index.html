        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
            The paper looked at issues concerning choice of career among students. After a brief look at what 
            career choice and development is, the paper describes some terms associated with career; terms that 
            are considered synonymous by many but are actually different. The paper is based upon the system 
            theory which focuses on the importance of society and the environment along with individual 
            differences, and it is also based upon the chaos theory which focuses on the complexities of social 
            realities and the unpredictable incidents they will generate. Furthermore, the paper discusses various 
            assumptions or perspectives underlying career choice, such as the belief that opportunities and choices 
            should be available for all people, regardless of sex, socio-economic class, religion, disability, 
            sexual orientation, age, or cultural background.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            In the past, most people prepared for a job and remained in that line until they retired. 
            Consequently, the laymanâ€™s understanding of career development is from a static perspective. 
            But now, as occupations are changing rapidly and society is becoming increasingly complex and 
            multicultural, individuals need to plan for diverging rather than converging career paths; 
            then it is essential that the context of career decisions should be dynamic.
        </p>
