<h3>SCENE I. An apartment in the DUKE'S palace.</h3>

<p><i>Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, ESCALUS, Lords and Attendants</i></p>

<p><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></p>
<p>Escalus.</p>

<p><b>ESCALUS</b></p>
<p>My lord.</p>

<p><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></p>
<p>Of government the properties to unfold,<br>
Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;<br>
Since I am put to know that your own science<br>
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice<br>
My strength can give you: then no more remains,<br>
But that to your sufficiency as your Worth is able,<br>
And let them work. The nature of our people,<br>
Our city's institutions, and the terms<br>
For common justice, you're as pregnant in<br>
As art and practise hath enriched any<br>
That we remember. There is our commission,<br>
From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,<br>
I say, bid come before us Angelo.</p>

<p><i>Exit an Attendant</i></p>

<p>What figure of us think you he will bear?<br>
For you must know, we have with special soul<br>
Elected him our absence to supply,<br>
Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,<br>
And given his deputation all the organs<br>
Of our own power: what think you of it?</p>

<p><b>ESCALUS</b></p>
<p>If any in Vienna be of worth<br>
To undergo such ample grace and honour,<br>
It is Lord Angelo.</p>

<p><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></p>
<p>Look where he comes.</p>
<p><i>Enter ANGELO</i></p>

<p><b>ANGELO</b></p>
<p>Always obedient to your grace's will,<br>
I come to know your pleasure.</p>

<p><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></p>
<p>Angelo,<br>
There is a kind of character in thy life,<br>
That to the observer doth thy history<br>
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings<br>
Are not thine own so proper as to waste<br>
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.<br>
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,<br>
Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues<br>
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike<br>
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd<br>
But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends<br>
The smallest scruple of her excellence<br>
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines<br>
Herself the glory of a creditor,<br>
Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech<br>
To one that can my part in him advertise;<br>
Hold therefore, Angelo:--<br>
In our remove be thou at full ourself;<br>
Mortality and mercy in Vienna<br>
Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,<br>
Though first in question, is thy secondary.<br>
Take thy commission.</p>

<p><b>ANGELO</b></p>
<p>Now, good my lord,<br>
Let there be some more test made of my metal,<br>
Before so noble and so great a figure<br>
Be stamp'd upon it.</p>

<p><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></p>
<p>No more evasion:<br>
We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice<br>
Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.<br>
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition<br>
That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd<br>
Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,<br>
As time and our concernings shall importune,<br>
How it goes with us, and do look to know<br>
What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;<br>
To the hopeful execution do I leave you<br>
Of your commissions.</p>

<p><b>ANGELO</b></p>
<p>Yet give leave, my lord,<br>
That we may bring you something on the way.</p>

<p><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></p>
<p>My haste may not admit it;<br>
Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do<br>
With any scruple; your scope is as mine own<br>
So to enforce or qualify the laws<br>
As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:<br>
I'll privily away. I love the people,<br>
But do not like to stage me to their eyes:<br>
Though it do well, I do not relish well<br>
Their loud applause and Aves vehement;<br>
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion<br>
That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.</p>

<p><b>ANGELO</b></p>
<p>The heavens give safety to your purposes!</p>

<p><b>ESCALUS</b></p>
<p>Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!</p>

<p><b>DUKE</b></p>
<p>I thank you. Fare you well.</p>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>

<p><b>ESCALUS</b></p>
<p>I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave<br>
To have free speech with you; and it concerns me<br>
To look into the bottom of my place:<br>
A power I have, but of what strength and nature<br>
I am not yet instructed.</p>

<p><b>ANGELO</b></p>
<p>'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,<br>
And we may soon our satisfaction have<br>
Touching that point.</p>

<p><b>ESCALUS</b></p>
<p>I'll wait upon your honour.</p>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>

    <h1>Addendum</h1>
    <p>The `&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;` tag defines the document type and version of HTML being used, in this case, HTML 4.0 Transitional. </p>
     <p> The `&lt;html&gt;` tag encloses the entire HTML document, marking the beginning and end of the HTML code. </p> 
     <p> The `&lt;head&gt;` tag contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as the title and character set. </p> 
     <p> The `&lt;title&gt;` tag sets the title of the HTML page, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab. </p> 
     <p> The `&lt;meta&gt;` tag specifies the character encoding for the document, in this case, ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1), which defines how characters are interpreted. </p> 
     <p> The `&lt;body&gt;` tag contains all the visible content on the webpage, including text, images, and links. </p> 
     <p> The `bgcolor` attribute inside the `&lt;body&gt;` tag sets the background color of the webpage to white (`#ffffff`), and the `text` attribute defines the text color as black (`#000000`). </p>
     <p> The `&lt;article&gt;` tag is a semantic tag used to enclose a self-contained piece of content. It can be used to group sections of a webpage like chapters or blog posts. </p> 
     <p> The `&lt;table&gt;` tag is used to create a table. In this case, it is used to organize the content inside a grid. </p> 
     <p> The `width="100%"` attribute inside the `&lt;table&gt;` tag makes the table span the entire width of the webpage, and the `bgcolor="#CCF6F6"` attribute sets a light blue background color for the table. </p> 
     <p> The `&lt;tr&gt;` tag defines a row in the table, while the `&lt;td&gt;` tag defines a cell within that row. In this code, the cells contain text and links. </p> 
     <p> The `align="center"` attribute inside the `&lt;td&gt;` tag centers the content within that cell. </p> <p> The `&lt;a&gt;` tag creates a hyperlink, and the `href` attribute specifies the URL to which the link points. In this case, it links to different parts of Shakespeare's works. </p> 
     <p> The `&lt;h3&gt;` tag is used to define a heading, with the number indicating the level of the heading. Here, it marks "Scene I" as a third-level heading. </p> <p> The `&lt;p&gt;` tag is used to define paragraphs of text. Each spoken part of the scene is enclosed within `&lt;p&gt;` tags. </p> 
     <p> The `&lt;i&gt;` tag italicizes the text it contains, typically used here for stage directions or actions (e.g., "Enter ANGELO"). </p> <p> The `&lt;b&gt;` tag makes the text bold, used in this case to emphasize the names of the characters speaking. </p> 
     <p> The `&lt;footer&gt;` tag defines the footer section of the page, typically containing closing information such as copyright or last update details. </p>
     <p> The `&lt;script&gt;` tag is used to embed JavaScript code within the HTML document. Here, the script retrieves the last modified date of the document and displays it on the page. </p> 
     <p> The `var x = document.lastModified;` statement in JavaScript captures the last modified date of the document, and `document.getElementById('lastModified').textContent = x;` sets the captured date as the content of the `lastModified` element.</p>
<footer>
      <p>Last updated: 
          <span id="lastModified"></span>
      </p>
  </footer>
  <script type="text/javascript">
       var x = document.lastModified;
       document.getElementById('lastModified').textContent = x;
