<h3>SCENE I. An apartment in the DUKE'S palace.</h3>

<p><i>Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, ESCALUS, Lords and Attendants</i></p>

<p><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></p>
<p>Escalus.</p>

<p><b>ESCALUS</b></p>
<p>My lord.</p>

<p><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></p>
<p>Of government the properties to unfold,<br>
Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;<br>
Since I am put to know that your own science<br>
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice<br>
My strength can give you: then no more remains,<br>
But that to your sufficiency as your Worth is able,<br>
And let them work. The nature of our people,<br>
Our city's institutions, and the terms<br>
For common justice, you're as pregnant in<br>
As art and practise hath enriched any<br>
That we remember. There is our commission,<br>
From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,<br>
I say, bid come before us Angelo.</p>

<p><i>Exit an Attendant</i></p>

<p>What figure of us think you he will bear?<br>
For you must know, we have with special soul<br>
Elected him our absence to supply,<br>
Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,<br>
And given his deputation all the organs<br>
Of our own power: what think you of it?</p>

<p><b>ESCALUS</b></p>
<p>If any in Vienna be of worth<br>
To undergo such ample grace and honour,<br>
It is Lord Angelo.</p>

<p><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></p>
<p>Look where he comes.</p>
<p><i>Enter ANGELO</i></p>

<p><b>ANGELO</b></p>
<p>Always obedient to your grace's will,<br>
I come to know your pleasure.</p>

<p><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></p>
<p>Angelo,<br>
There is a kind of character in thy life,<br>
That to the observer doth thy history<br>
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings<br>
Are not thine own so proper as to waste<br>
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.<br>
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,<br>
Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues<br>
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike<br>
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd<br>
But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends<br>
The smallest scruple of her excellence<br>
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines<br>
Herself the glory of a creditor,<br>
Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech<br>
To one that can my part in him advertise;<br>
Hold therefore, Angelo:--<br>
In our remove be thou at full ourself;<br>
Mortality and mercy in Vienna<br>
Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,<br>
Though first in question, is thy secondary.<br>
Take thy commission.</p>

<p><b>ANGELO</b></p>
<p>Now, good my lord,<br>
Let there be some more test made of my metal,<br>
Before so noble and so great a figure<br>
Be stamp'd upon it.</p>

<p><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></p>
<p>No more evasion:<br>
We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice<br>
Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.<br>
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition<br>
That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd<br>
Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,<br>
As time and our concernings shall importune,<br>
How it goes with us, and do look to know<br>
What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;<br>
To the hopeful execution do I leave you<br>
Of your commissions.</p>

<p><b>ANGELO</b></p>
<p>Yet give leave, my lord,<br>
That we may bring you something on the way.</p>

<p><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></p>
<p>My haste may not admit it;<br>
Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do<br>
With any scruple; your scope is as mine own<br>
So to enforce or qualify the laws<br>
As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:<br>
I'll privily away. I love the people,<br>
But do not like to stage me to their eyes:<br>
Though it do well, I do not relish well<br>
Their loud applause and Aves vehement;<br>
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion<br>
That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.</p>

<p><b>ANGELO</b></p>
<p>The heavens give safety to your purposes!</p>

<p><b>ESCALUS</b></p>
<p>Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!</p>

<p><b>DUKE</b></p>
<p>I thank you. Fare you well.</p>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>

<p><b>ESCALUS</b></p>
<p>I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave<br>
To have free speech with you; and it concerns me<br>
To look into the bottom of my place:<br>
A power I have, but of what strength and nature<br>
I am not yet instructed.</p>

<p><b>ANGELO</b></p>
<p>'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,<br>
And we may soon our satisfaction have<br>
Touching that point.</p>

<p><b>ESCALUS</b></p>
<p>I'll wait upon your honour.</p>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
